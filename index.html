    <h1>Contact.ie: Service Unavailable</h1>
      <p>
        After 11 years of providing the easiest way for people to contact politician in Ireland,
        including running some very popular and successful email campaigns, I have decided to stop the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 2 or so years, I have not been able to put enough time into the service, and 
        it has not been as popular as it was in previous years. I have a feeling people prefer to 
        just post messages on Facebook or Twitter to politicians rather than taking the time to 
        send an email, or write a letter, or call in person. I hope I'm wrong about that.
